# A Thousand Ways to Die: World Data

# Group 4 Project One


## Description

#### What are the leading causes of death in the world? Which Countries have the highest mortality rates? Why is this the case? These are all questions that motivate our project. We built this to analyze different socio-economic conditions and Physician Desserts to determine if they have any impact on the high mortality rates in particular areas. 


### Graphs and Charts that support our findings:

#### - A Map to Show Location of Deaths Around the World
#### - Bar Chart to show Causes of Death over Years
#### - Line Chart to show Causes of Death over Years
#### - Scatter Plot to show Socio-economic Status vs Physicians population
#### - Scatter Plot to show deaths vs physician/nurse population
#### - Scatter Line Regression to show correlation between deaths and physicians/nurse
